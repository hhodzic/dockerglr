# dockerglr
Run Gatherlog Reporter within docker container

# Overview
I was running into issues with getting gatherlog reporter running locally so figured to run it in the container could help me run it easier on different machines. 

# How to Run it

git clone <this repository>
  cd <this repository>
  docker build . -t glreporter
