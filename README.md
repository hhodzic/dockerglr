# dockerglr
Run Gatherlog Reporter within docker container

# Overview
I was running into issues with getting gatherlog reporter running locally so figured to run it in the container could help me run it easier on different machines. 

# How to Run it

```
git clone https://github.com/hhodzic/dockerglr.git
cd dockerglr
docker build . -t glreporter
```
